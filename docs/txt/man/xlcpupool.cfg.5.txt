NAME
    xlcpupool.cfg - XL Cpupool Configuration File Syntax

SYNOPSIS
     /etc/xen/xlcpupool

DESCRIPTION
    To create a Cpupool with xl requires the provision of a cpupool config
    file. Typically these live in `/etc/xen/CPUPOOL.cfg` where CPUPOOL is
    the name of the cpupool.

SYNTAX
    A cpupool config file consists of a series of "KEY=VALUE" pairs.

    A value "VALUE" is one of:

    "STRING"
        A string, surrounded by either single or double quotes.

    NUMBER
        A number, in either decimal, octal (using a 0 prefix) or hexadecimal
        (using an "0x" prefix).

    [ VALUE, VALUE, ... ]
        A list of "VALUES" of the above types. Lists are homogeneous and are
        not nested.

    The semantics of each "KEY" defines which form of "VALUE" is required.

OPTIONS
  Mandatory Configuration Items
    The following key is mandatory for any cpupool:

    name="NAME"
        Specifies the name of the cpupool. Names of cpupools existing on a
        single host must be unique.

  Optional Configuration Items
    The following options apply to guests of any type.

    sched="SCHED"
        Specifies the scheduler which is used for the cpupool. Valid values
        for "SCHED" are:

        credit
            the credit scheduler

        credit2
            the credit2 scheduler

        rtds
            the RTDS scheduler

        The default scheduler is the one used for "Pool-0" specified as boot
        parameter of the hypervisor.

    nodes="NODES"
        Specifies the cpus of the NUMA-nodes given in "NODES" (an integer or
        a list of integers) to be member of the cpupool. The free cpus in
        the specified nodes are allocated in the new cpupool.

    cpus="CPU-LIST"
        Specifies the cpus that will be member of the cpupool. All the
        specified cpus must be free, or creation will fail. "CPU-LIST" may
        be specified as follows:

        ["2", "3", "5"]
            means that cpus 2,3,5 will be member of the cpupool.

        "0-3,5,^1"
            means that cpus 0,2,3 and 5 will be member of the cpupool. A
            "node:" or "nodes:" modifier can be used. E.g.,
            "0,node:1,nodes:2-3,^10-13" means that pcpus 0, plus all the
            cpus of NUMA nodes 1,2,3 with the exception of cpus 10,11,12,13
            will be memeber of the cpupool.

        If neither nodes nor cpus are specified only the first free cpu
        found will be allocated in the new cpupool.
